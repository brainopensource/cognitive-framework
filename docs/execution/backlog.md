# AETHER / Vanguard: Feature & Capability Backlog

```text
====================================================================================================
Authority: Execution (Sequencing & Lifecycle Tracking)
Scope:     Capability Packages, Substrate Evolution, Tooling & Benchmarking Backlog
Lanes:     Lane A (Dev A — Senior Principal) | Lane B (Dev B — Independent Evaluator)
Invariant: Mechanism presence is not closure; state transitions require empirical receipts.
====================================================================================================
```

## 1. Lifecycle State Definitions

Every item in this backlog is managed through a strict predicate-driven lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    PROPOSED["PROPOSED<br/>(Candidate Idea / Hypothesis)"] -->|Architectural Review| APPROVED["APPROVED<br/>(Spec Ready / Awaiting WIP)"]
    APPROVED -->|Lane Capacity Available| IN_PROGRESS["IN_PROGRESS<br/>(Active in active.md)"]
    IN_PROGRESS -->|Evaluator Audit| REVIEWING["REVIEWING<br/>(Independent Verification)"]
    REVIEWING -->|Receipt Accepted| DONE["DONE<br/>(Verified & Merged)"]
    IN_PROGRESS -->|Unresolved Dependency| BLOCKED["BLOCKED<br/>(Prerequisite Missing)"]
    PROPOSED -->|Negative ROI / Lift| DEFERRED["DEFERRED<br/>(Rejected / Archived)"]
```

* **`PROPOSED`**: Candidate hypothesis, architectural proposal, or product feature under technical evaluation.
* **`APPROVED`**: Specification and falsifiers ratified; queued for active sprint execution once lane capacity (`WIP=1`) opens.
* **`IN_PROGRESS`**: Actively under implementation by the assigned lane owner in [`active.md`](active.md).
* **`REVIEWING`**: Code implemented; awaiting independent empirical evaluation and receipt production.
* **`BLOCKED`**: Execution halted due to prerequisite milestone gates (e.g., M-9 blocked on M-8).
* **`DONE`**: Implementation verified by passing tests, boundary checks, and frozen evidence receipts.
* **`DEFERRED`**: Candidate rejected or postponed due to lack of measured lift or architectural misalignment.
